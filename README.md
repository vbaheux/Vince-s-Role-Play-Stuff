Vince's Role Play Stuff
=======================

-> What is Vince's Role Play Stuff mod ?
   It's a mod developed with the FML API for Minecraft, which consists in introducing some new role play features
   in Minecraft. Some of these features are inspired from Vince's works on the AfterKraft server, which aren't
   published yet.
   
-> Things to come in this mod
   *Special tracks which increases the player's speed while walking on X and Z axes
   *New ores, like mythril, copper, silver, amber, and sapphire. (And mayber others)
   *New mobs : the dragon baby and the bear
   *New features for the Ender dragon (and the dragon baby) : they will drop dragon scales while they die, but
   there will be a 1% chance that they drop a Reliqual Dragon Stone, which can be used for a special chestplate.
   *Swords, pickaxes, axes, spades and hoes made of new ores/materials, for example Mythril, dragon scales, and
   maybe others.
   *New crops : malt and coffee beans.
   *Obviously, new types of food will come with these crops !
   *Think about fermenting blocks (for beer, and cider with apples)
   *A Lightning Sword, very difficult to obtain (in a dungeon)
   *New dungeon structures, very rare, but with very interesting objects (ex. Lightning Sword).
   *A Wizard wand, with a lot of available magic spells.
   *Clothes (kind of coloured wool armor, not very useful when fighting)
   *New weapons, like Waraxes, or stuff like that. (Didn't decided yet what to do).
   *Some decoration blocks (chairs, tables, benches)
   *Well, don't know if I'll make that because of future MC 1.4, but maybe there'll be walls.
   *Hand Lanterns, which lights when selected in hand, but also when you put it like a torch.
   *New trees, like the orange tree (only in frozen biomes) -> Oranges will give you a 4 heart healing.
   
   Well, that will be all for the first version of the mod, but there will be updates.
   Currently I'm developing the mod, so i'll put regular updates on my repo.
   
   Thanks for reading, 
   Vinceguit.
